UWOC Using OptiSystem Tool ‚Äî Mini Project Phase-1
Name: AJAY M S
Institution: Sir M. Visvesvaraya Institute of Technology, under Visvesvaraya Technological University
Department: Electronics and Communication Engineering
Academic Year: 2024-25
Guide: Ms. Vijayalakshmi S., Associate Professor, Dept. of ECE

üìñ Project Overview
This project explores Underwater Wireless Optical Communication (UWOC) as a high-speed, short-range data transmission solution for underwater environments. Using the OptiSystem simulation tool, we designed and evaluated a point-to-point UWOC system, focusing on performance metrics such as bit error rate (BER), power loss, and the impact of water turbidity on signal propagation.

üõ†Ô∏è Key Objectives
Design a point-to-point optical wireless communication system.
Achieve high data transfer rates underwater.
Analyze signal propagation characteristics in UWOC channels.
Implement and optimize SISO (Single Input Single Output) techniques.
Evaluate system performance under varied underwater conditions.

üõ†Ô∏è Methodology
Data Generation: PRBS generator ‚Üí NRZ pulse train.
Modulation: NRZ-modulated CW laser signal.
Transmission: Signal propagated through a simulated underwater channel introducing loss and distortion.
Reception: PIN photodiode for optical-to-electrical signal conversion.

Analysis: Performance evaluated using BER analyzers, optical spectrum analyzers, and oscilloscopes.

üí° Software Used
OptiSystem: A comprehensive platform for designing and testing optical communication systems, including UWOC.

üöÄ Outcomes
Demonstrated feasibility of UWOC with point-to-point SISO techniques.
Showed the potential for reliable, efficient underwater data transmission.
Identified water turbidity and depth as critical factors affecting performance.

üîÆ Future Scope
Explore advanced modulation techniques (e.g., DPSK, QPSK).
Improve power efficiency and system range.
Integrate with IoT and AI for real-time underwater data monitoring and processing.
